# Eyes For Blind
## To read the unreadable 
We know that technology is increasing its support to our society day by day. This project is thought to be a part of this innovation process by providing a support to *blind people in going grocery shopping*.

### Recognize text in supermarket items
The task is to help blind people to read what they can not. Often supermarket items don't have a braille translation of their name and descriptions. We provide an app that can spot text in images, transcript it and read it with the phone's text-to-speech.
